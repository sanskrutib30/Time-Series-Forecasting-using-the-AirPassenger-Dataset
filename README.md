# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-the-AirPassenger-Dataset
# Summary:-
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data using the AirPassengers dataset. The dataset records monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of time series preprocessing, trend analysis, and visualization, serving as a foundation for understanding seasonality, trend components, and forecasting models in real-world datasets.
# Key Features
Imported and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas.
Converted date fields to datetime format and set them as index for time-based operations.
Visualized trends and seasonal patterns using Matplotlib.
Explored foundational time series analysis techniques for forecasting.
Built an interpretable framework to identify data patterns for predictive modeling.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Time Series Analysis

# Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates core concepts of time series forecasting, including data cleaning, date-time indexing, and visualization — providing a base for applying advanced models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM in future iterations.
